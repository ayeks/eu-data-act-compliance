### Best Practices for Company Reviews

1. **Be objective and factual** - Base your review on publicly available information or direct experience
2. **Provide evidence** - Include links to documentation where possible
3. **Be specific** - "Good API" is not as helpful as "REST API with detailed OpenAPI specification"
4. **Date your review** - Implementation may change over time
5. **Focus on implementation** - Document how companies are actually implementing the requirements, not just stated policies

## Updating Existing Reviews

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `update-company-samsung`)
3. **Make your changes** to the appropriate file
4. **Add a review update note** at the bottom of the file with date and summary of changes
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your updates
